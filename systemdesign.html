    <h1>Aim and Details of the project</h1>


  <h4>1.1 AIM: </h4>
    <p>To develop a system of improved facilities. The proposed system can overcome all the limitations
of the existing system. The proposed system tries to eliminate or reduce these difficulties up to
some extent. The proposed system is file compressed or decompressed based on the Gzip
algorithm. The system is very simple in design and to implement . The system requires very low
system resources and the system will work in almost all configurations.</p>
<h4>1.2 Details of the project:</h4>
<p>The project is divided into 3modules such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compress A File</li>
  <li>De-compress the file</li>
  <li>View files in the compressed file</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>(1) Compress A File: </h4>
  <p>This module helps us to compress a file . The compressed file will
have a extension that has been given at the development time. We can send the compressed
file over the internet so that users having the software can decompress it.</p>
<h4>(2) Decompress the file:</h4>
<p>This is the reverse process of the file compression . here we can
decompress the compressed file and get the original file.
</p>
<h4>(3) View files in the compressed file: </h4>
<p>Here we can view the list of files inside our
compressed file. We can view the files before compressing and decide to decompress or
not .</p>
