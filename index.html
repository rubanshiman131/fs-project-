    <h1 style="text-allign:centre;">FILE COMPRESSION & DECOMPRESSION IN JAVA</h1>
    <p>File compression is a process of reducing the size of a file by minimizing redundant
data. File compression creates a compressed version of a file by minimizing this
redundant data. File decompression is the process of restoring compressed data to its
original form, decompression is required in almost all cases of compressed data,
including lossy and lossless compression. Gzip is a method of compressing files for
faster network transfers. It is also a file format. Compression allows your web
servers to provide smaller file sizes which load faster for your website users.</p>
